## Chutes and Ladders 

_Simulated via Monte Carlo and Markov chains_

This is my for-fun implementation of Nick Berry's [simulations of Chutes and Ladders](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/november12011/index.html) to explain the Monte Carlo and Markov chain methods.

This is very basic at the moment. I may make it nicer or just use this Python code as backend for a different visualization.

License statement: Feel free to play with this code and use it for what ever you'd like.

Both simulations require numpy and optionally matplotlib.

The todo list includes:
* Code for parallel runs of the Monte Carlo simulation. Possibly via the picloud local library.
* Clean up the plotting of the game boards in the Markov chain version.
* Overall nicer plotting. It's just basic enough to verify results at this stage.
